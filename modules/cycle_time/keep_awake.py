keep_awake.py  (cycle_time)
───────────────────────────
Keep Windows awake for the duration of a long ingest so the machine can be
left unattended without the network connection being torn down by sleep.

Background: a long paginated pull (LAMRESEARCH ≈ 1,056 pages, KEYSIGHT more)
can run for hours. If the laptop goes to idle-sleep mid-run, the OS suspends
the network stack and any in-flight socket dies with
`ConnectionResetError(10054, 'An existing connection was forcibly closed')`.

This uses the Win32 `SetThreadExecutionState` API to tell Windows "a task is
running, don't idle-sleep the system or turn off the display" for as long as
the calling thread holds the flag. The flag is released automatically on exit
(including on crash / Ctrl+C), so normal power behaviour resumes afterward.

Caveats:
  - Idle-sleep is prevented. Sleep triggered by CLOSING THE LID is a separate
    hardware/policy action that this API does NOT override on most laptops —
    keep the lid open, or set the AC lid-close action to "Do nothing".
  - No-op on non-Windows platforms (returns a null context).
