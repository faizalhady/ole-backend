assembly_summary.py  (cycle_time)
─────────────────────────────────
Builds assembly_summary.parquet — ONE row per (customer, assembly) holding
exactly what the "Cycle Time by Assembly" list page renders, with the heavy
bits PRECOMPUTED so the /assembly-list endpoint is a cheap read instead of a
live aggregation over millions of raw rows.

Precomputed per assembly:
  • identity        — family
  • build counts    — builds, revisions, primary_builds, has_alternates
  • stage footprint — has_smt / has_th / has_be
  • SMH             — operator content per unit (the value that was being
                      recomputed on every page load and slowing KEYSIGHT down)
  • eff             — line efficiency, joined from eff_by_line.parquet when it
                      exists (built from GetSummaryGroupProcessData). NULL until
                      that pull has run.

This is a LOCAL transform over raw.parquet (already on disk) — no API calls.
Runs in seconds-to-minutes even for the largest customer.
