.SYNOPSIS
  Register the daily IE Pulse pipeline scheduled tasks (OLE + Cycle Time).

.DESCRIPTION
  Creates / updates Windows scheduled tasks:

    IEPulse-OLE-Ingest-PaidHours    10:45  - 5 min after paid-hours upload (10:40)
    IEPulse-OLE-Ingest-Production   13:05  - 5 min after production upload (13:00)
    IEPulse-CycleTime-Ingest        02:00  - overnight incremental IEDB refresh

  OLE tasks read BOTH sources (paid_hours + production). The state file +
  date-stitching make it safe to run twice a day:
    - State "since" mark skips files already processed
    - seen_dates seed prevents row duplication
    - _merge_with_existing absorbs any overlap

  Cycle Time runs incremental (delta + upsert): fetches only IEDB records
  changed since last run, upserts into raw.parquet by primary key (no dupes,
  no data loss, no cross-workcell changes), then rebuilds pivoted /
  assembly_summary / eBuild runner mart. Safe to run daily.

  Idempotent - re-run this script any time to update timings; existing
  tasks with the same names are replaced.

.NOTES
  - This script lives in scripts/ and resolves the project root one level up.
  - Run from an ELEVATED PowerShell prompt:
        .\scripts\setup_scheduled_tasks.ps1
  - Logon mode: Password - tasks run whether the user is logged on or not.
    You will be prompted ONCE for your Windows username + password; the
    credential is stored encrypted in Windows Task Scheduler.

# run and upserts into raw.parquet, then chains transform -> assembly_summary ->
# eBuild runner mart. Safe to run daily (upsert by key: no dupes, no data loss,

# the 24-month eBuild runner pull. NOTE: incremental can't heal old missed rows
# (watermark blind spot) — run a manual --backfill periodically for that.
